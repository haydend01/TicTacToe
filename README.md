# TicTacToe

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, written in C++.

To play the game, simply compile and run the program in Visual Studio Community. The game will wait for the current player to choose the first square to begin the game. The current player is indicated by the cube moving across the screen.

The game ends when one of the players gets three of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all of the cells on the board are filled without a winner being determined. In the latter case, the game is a tie.

I hope you enjoy playing my Tic Tac Toe game! Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements.

Happy trials!
Have fun!
